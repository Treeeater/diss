Having a secure implementation of the authentication system lays a solid foundation for a successful application.  The application's native authentication approach might be secure, but situation might get complicated when the application integrates third-party SSO services.  Recent years, many researchers have done work to find vulnerabilities in such integrations (more details in Section~\ref{}), but these discoveries are made by mostly manual effort.  This motivates us to develop a more systematic approach, through which we hope to offer more confidence to the service provider and the application developer that
